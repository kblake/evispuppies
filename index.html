                    camping and road-trips and is always ready for an adventure and always by your side for a day in🤍

                <em>"Let me introduce you to our Aussiedoodle, Dasher. Dasher was the firstborn puppy of F1
                    Aussiedoodle, Evi, on December 24, 2022. He became ours at 10 weeks of age. He was litter box
                    trained and as a result was house trained quite easily. He is smart, energetic, cute and cuddly. He
                    loves his chew toys and has not been a destructive to our property for which we are thankful. He
                    loves going for walks with us and especially enjoys playing in the backyard off leash chasing tennis
                    balls and frisbees! We love our puppy and are happy he is part of our family."</em>

                <em>"A year ago we adopted our adorable Buttons. She is incredibly healthy, happy, sweet, lovable and oh
                    so intelligent. She was very easy to train and bonded with us and our mini Goldendoodle right away.
                    Teddi and Buttons are inseparable. We are so happy to have Buttons as a part of our family."</em>

                <em>"Meet Bailey-Bear Timmy Rodgers ...why 3 names? I liked Bailey my daughter liked Bear and she was
                    the
                    smallest of the puppies so she is also named after my brother...the runt of our family. If that's
                    not enough she is often called "pooky"..again my daughter.

                    Bailey-bear is a sweet combination of fun, active and a snuggler. She loves her big sister and plays
                    with her all the time and is very independent and will play by herself.. admittedly I've lost a sock
                    or two with her shenanigans but that face too cute to be mad. She loves to swim and surprised me
                    when she jumped off our dock the 1st day we brought her to the water. She is fearless and enjoys
                    being 32' in the air more than she should. Bailey is a shop dog and goes to work with me most days.
                    Customers and staff love her. She can do some basic tricks we taught her sit, down, shake and high
                    5. She likes to end her day snuggling next to me in my chair and then off to bed. She's a great
                    friend."</em>

                <em>"We were lucky enough to adopt Mister from Karmen and Allison. The addition of Mister to our family
                    has been a blessing. Mister loves to love!! He adores climbing in our lap like a big baby, he
                    snuggles and loves to be near us. He is energetic and playful. Once he gets his wiggles out when a
                    guest arrives he settles in and enjoys being part of the conversation. He is gentle with our
                    grandchildren. And he mostly obeys the house rules. Allison was an incredible help to us as I had
                    never raised a puppy before. She sent him home fully potty trained!! She continues to answer
                    questions, offer advice and simply check in. Thank you for our wonderful Mister!!

                    We highly recommend!!"</em>
